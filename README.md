# Blog with React and Node.js üìù  

Live App: https://garoihouse.com/

## Overview  
A simple and clean blog application built with React on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend. It allows users to create, read, and interact with blog posts fetched dynamically via API calls. The design emphasizes minimalism and smooth scrolling interactions to enhance the user experience.

This project highlights my skills in **frontend and backend integration**, **API development**, and **state management using React hooks**.

## Features  
- **Frontend**: Built with React, featuring a user-friendly interface for reading and creating posts.  
- **Backend**: Uses Express.js to handle API requests and serve mock data.
- **State Management:** Utilized React hooks (such as useState and useEffect) to manage dynamic data changes and updates seamlessly.
- **UX/UI Design**: Designed from scratch, including initial wireframes and layout planning.  
- **Wireframes & Screenshots**: Includes sketches of the initial wireframes and screenshots of the final design.  
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented scroll-to-section functionality for better navigation.

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **API**: RESTful API with mock data
- **State Management**: React useState, useEffect
- **Deployment**: Hosting via Garoi House
